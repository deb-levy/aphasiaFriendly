Discrepancy between inner and overt speech: Implications for post-stroke aphasia and normal language processing
Sharon Geva 1, Sophie Bennett2, Elizabeth A. Warburton1, and Karalyn Patterson3
Background: Patients with aphasia often complain that there is a poor correlation between the words they think (inner speech) and the words they say (overt speech). Aims: This study tried to characterise the relation between inner speech and overt speech in post-stroke aphasia.
Methods & Procedures: We tested language abilities, speech apraxia, and performance on inner speech tasks, including homophone and rhyme judgements, of 27 patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia.
Outcomes & Results: The patients with aphasia were distributed across the entire spec- trum of abilities related to both inner and overt speech. For most patients, performance levels of inner and overt speech were similar. However, some patients had relatively better-preserved inner speech with a marked deficit in overt speech, while in others the opposite pattern was observed.
Conclusions: The results are discussed within the framework of current models of language, and their implications for language therapy and aphasia diagnosis are outlined.
