Modern texts continue to cite Broca's 1861 study of a single patient, Tan, as the first definitive localization of a cerebral function, specifically, articulate speech. We describe the development of Broca'stheoryfromhisinitialsupportin 1861 for Boulliaud's view that speech is localized in both frontal lobes to his description in 1865 of a center for articu- late speech in the third left frontal convo- lution. We have translated Broca's 1865 French report. Despite the revival of "classical" anatomically based concepts of discrete aphasic syndromes, numerous clinicoanatomical correlation studies have failed to confirm the specific lan- guage impairment described by Broca. Broca's own descriptions of language development in the third right frontal con- volution following left hemisphere dam- age also raise questions about the validity of theories of brain-behavior relationships based on punctate localization of specific mental functions.
