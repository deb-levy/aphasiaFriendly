    "Q": "Who is ArticleFriend NOT for?",
    "A": "ArticleFriend is NOT currently intended for use by individuals without research expertise. 
        Large language models, such as those used here, can often 'hallucinate' and misunderstand inputted texts. 
        All output should be edited and verified by someone with research expertise before results are made public."

    "Q": "Why do you need to authenticate my Google account in order for me to use ArticleFriend? ",
    "A": "The output of ArticleFriend is currently output to Google Docs, which requires the authentication of a Google account. 
        This authentication to Google is temporary, and ArticleFriend only has access to the document it produced. 
        We do not store any information about your account."
