 Analysis of lesions by MRI in stroke patients with acoustic-phonetic processing deficits

w e tested 10 aphasic stroke patients for the ability to discriminate and identify English phonemes. All patients underwent MRI and had their scans analyzed morphometrically. Patients with impairments in acoustic- phonetic processing tended to have lesions involving the left posterior supramarginal gyrus and the bordering parietal operculum, an observation further supported by regression and correlation analyses. These results are interpreted as evidence that the region including the left posterior supramarginal gyrus and parietal operculum plays a significant role in acoustic-phonetic processing.
