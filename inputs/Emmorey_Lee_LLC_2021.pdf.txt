The neurocognitive basis of skilled reading in prelingually and profoundly deaf adults

Deaf individuals have unique sensory and linguistic ex- periences that influence how they read and become skilled readers. This review presents our current un- derstanding of the neurocognitive underpinnings of reading skill in deaf adults. Key behavioural and neu- roimaging studies are integrated to build a profile of skilled adult deaf readers and to examine how changes in visual attention and reduced access to auditory input and phonology shape how they read both words and sen- tences. Crucially, the behaviours, processes, and neural circuity of deaf readers are compared to those of hearing readers with similar reading ability to help identify alternative pathways to reading success. Overall, sensi- tivity to orthographic and semantic information is comparable for skilled deaf and hearing readers, but deaf readers rely less on phonology and show greater engagement of the right hemisphere in visual word processing. During sentence reading, deaf readers pro- cess visual word forms more efficiently and may have a greater reliance on and altered connectivity to semantic information compared to their hearing peers. These findings highlight the plasticity of the reading system and point to alternative pathways to reading success.
